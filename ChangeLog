Revision 1.2-1 (2012-07-11): Hermine's edition patch 1
* Fixed to depend on R>=2.15.0

Revision 1.2-0 (2012-07-09): Hermine's edition
* Upgraded to KFAS 0.9.9
* Upgraded to FKF 0.1.2
* Added NAMESPACE

Revision 1.1-0 (2011-02-14): Valentine's edition
* Changed tseasonal: state disturbance is now a 1x1 matrix
* Improved dlmodeler print function with number of unknown params
* Greatly improved speed of the forecast function (typically > 10x)
* Added support for using NA in build functions. NA indicates unknown
  parameters of the model, they will be automatically estimated by
  the dlmodeler.fit functions
* Added MAPE fitting function

Revision 1.0-0 (2010-12-31): Sylvester's edition
* First public release of the package to CRAN
* Illustrated the usage of package function with examples taken from
  Durbin & Koopman book
* Added support for ARIMA models (currently only ARMA has been
  implemented)

Revision 0.2-0 (2010-12-28):
* Fixed handling of the selection matrix Rt
* Fixed bugs in timevar.fun
* Improved functions to check their arguments
* Improved the forecast simulation function to support time-varying
  models (current implementation is slow, but speed will be improved)
* Added AIC and BIC computation for fitted models
* Added MSE, MAD and sigma fitting functions (in addition to MLE)
* Added support for variance and prediction intervals extraction
* Added support for exact diffuse initialization (with KFAS back-end)
* Added MLE fitting function (using optim(), w/ BFGS optimization)
* Renamed "simulate" to "forecast" to avoid confusion with simulation
  methods for exponential family models

Revision 0.1-0 (2010-12-20):
* Init R package & man pages
* Added helper functions for polynomial, dseasonal, tseasonal
* Added support for regression and time-varying models
* Added filtering and smoothing with KFAS and FKF back-ends
* Added notion of components (in this version, only the expectation
  is supported, future versions will support extraction of the
  variance)
* Added preliminary dlmodeler print function

Revision 0.0-0 (2010-06-05):
* Added generic DLM representation (in this version, time-varying
  models are not yet supported and will be implemented in the future)
* Added filtering and smoothing with package dlm back-end (other
  back-ends will be added in the future)
* Added functions to build structural time-series models using
  package dlm's helper functions
* Added forecast simulation function
