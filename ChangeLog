Revision 0.2-0 (2010-12-27)
 * Fixed handling of the selection matrix Rt
 * Fixed a bug in timevar.fun
 * Added support for exact diffuse initialization (with KFAS back-end)
 * Added MLE fitting function (using optim(), w/ BFGS optimization)
 * Renamed "simulate" to "forecast" to avoid confusion with simulation
